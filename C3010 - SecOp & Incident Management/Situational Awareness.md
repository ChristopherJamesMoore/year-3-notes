<h3>What is situational awareness?</h3> 
<i>M. Endsley</i> - Human factors Journal
"Situation awareness is the perception of the elements of the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future"

<b>Endsley's model of situational awareness</b>

<b>Analysis of the Comair flight 5191 accident</b>
This accidents situation awareness can be broken down into three levels:
- Perception
	- The pilots did not correctly perceive the environmental cues indicating they were on the wrong runway.
- Comprehension
	- This incorrect perception led to failure to comprehend that they were on an unsuitable runway for take-off.
- Projection
	- As a result, they failed to project the dire consequences of attempting a take-off from a short runway, ultimately resulting in the tragic accident.

<h3>What is cyber situation awareness (CSA)?</h3>
An application of generic situational awareness (SA) into the cyber domain.
- Perceiving the cyber environment,
- understanding the current security situation,
- being able to project how the situation will evolve.

<h4>Challenges in CSA</h4>

<h3>OODA loop</h3>
- Observe 
	- What is the current situation? What is the reason you want it to change? How bad do you want it to change?
- Orient
	- Where are you currently at relative to where you want to go?
- Decide
	- What is the exact path you want to take? How are you going to handle challenges and setbacks?
- Act
	- What is the approach and method you will take to implement the decisions? What is your action plan

<h3>Threat intelligence</h3>
Threat intelligence refers to the process of collecting, analysing, and using information about current or potential cyber threats to help organisations understand, predict, and defend attacks.

It involves gathering data about threat actors, their tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and analysing this data to produce actionable insights that organisations can use to improve their security posture.

<h3>Situational awareness in <i>information environment</h3></i>
The information environment is the aggregate of individuals, organisations, and systems (resources) that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information.

The information environment can be broken into three distant domains, but these are not separate and information can pass across different domains (social-technical, cyber-physical, etc...).
- Physical 
	- The physical domain can be used to take contextual information:
		- Location
		- Environmental hazards
		- Traffic of physical objects
	- This can provide situational information, but also operational technology (e.g., robotic arms) have cross cyber and physical domains.
- Information
	- The bulk of cyber-security information, used for situational awareness, is gathered in this domain. For IT security, all can be collected here. Here most information necessary for situational awareness is:
		- Generated
		- Collected
		- Processed
		- Stored
		- Disseminated 
		- Displayed
		- Protected
- Cognitive
	- The human cognition is a nice term for computer-human interactions 
		- Most systems designed to be user driven
		- Accurate data can be misinterpreted
		- Processing information
		- Construction understanding
		- Applying knowledge
		- Solving issues

<b>Benefits of situational awareness in threat intelligence</b>
What is going on in your environment?
How can this information be used to aid decisions?
- Organisation risk assessment
- Organisation cyber-security prevention/ detection
- Security hardening of single devices or network/ network segments
- Response to attack/ compromise

<b>Benefits of situational awareness, threat intelligence in Policies and Governance</b>
Organisational assets exist to enable day-to-day operations. Prioritising protecting these assets should be clear based on possible outcomes.
- Nothing is "100% secure", prioritising the important.
- Asset protection policy prevent security incidences/ breaches.
- Intrusion detection detects when incident/ breaches occurs
- Policy determine how to respond to issues
The better the understanding about how individual/ networked assets are used, by who, and when, determine likelihood of issue and the threat intelligence help prioritise security solutions.

<h3>Situational awareness terms within the module</h3>
Situational awareness with be thought of in terms of four components:
1. Know what the system is, and how it should work
2. Track the digital information in the system
3. Understand behaviours (e.g., abnormal vs normal)
4. React to abnormal or malicious behaviours
There are many terms for general SA, but these work best with a lot of the networking aspects that will be focused on.

<b>Know the system</b>
Before jumping into network cybersecurity, an understanding of the network topology users and uses is needed.
- Legitimate users of internal/ public-facing systems and networks
- Authorised devices on network and use
- Approved processes and application (where allowed, how used)
The more precise the information to security personally and detection solutions, the easier to detect issues and address them. Well-defined policies, trained employees, updated systems, detailed network diagrams, and well designed security systems all help.

<b>Track the information</b>
Knowing what <i>should be</i> and knowing <i>what is</i> are different. Cybersecurity teams cannot directly monitor all in information domain monitoring tools are needed.
- Observed devices, processes/ applications, and users
- Watch known vulnerabilities in devices, processes, and applications
- How usage patterns and cycles exist for system, devices, and users
Different terms, but need information points and a way to integrate that information that is useful to analysts.

<b>Understand behaviours</b>
A security issue occurs when something that should not happen, does. Some of these are very difficult to detect. Some high-level methods to understand behaviours are:
- Direct policy violation
- Deviations from historical data
- Unusual outliers showing up in outlier-detection analyses
- "newness" identification
- Tactic, technique, and procedure matching

<b>React</b>
Going through steps 1-3 is not very useful if in the end the organisation does not plan to act on the threat intelligence/ SA.
- Report to the appropriate people
- Ethically analyse the incident further
- Clean up system, removing threat
- Hardening system to prevent repeat
